# crucible-canned-responses

Helps you to can usual code review comments for repeated use. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

## How to get it
[Install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-canned-responses/lhehmppafakahahobaibfcomknkhoina)

## What is it
The extension adds a little button inside crucible
comment editing view, that allows you to choose one of the existing canned responses, and insert it in the current comment.

## Adding your own canned responses
The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! In the dropdown, press the edit link, and you'll get something like this:
