# crucible-canned-responses

Helps you to can usual code review comments for repeated use. A lot of them will need the same answer, and your wrists will start hurting from all the switch-to-edit-copy-pasting. This extension helps with that.

## How to get it

[Install it from the Chrome Web Store]()

## What is it

The extension adds a little button inside crucible comment editing view, that allows you to choose one of the existing canned responses, and insert it in the current comment.

#### With auto comment turned OFF (default)

#### With auto comment turned ON

## Adding your own canned responses

The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! In the dropdown, press the edit link, and there you can add more canned responses and also change the auto comment option on/off.
